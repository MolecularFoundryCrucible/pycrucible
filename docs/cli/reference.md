# CLI command reference

This page is the canonical command inventory for the Crucible CLI. Use `crucible <command> --help` or `crucible <resource> <action> --help` for the exact arguments, aliases, defaults, and examples supported by the installed version.

## Global options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--version` | Print the installed client version and exit |
| `--debug` | Enable Crucible debug logging; place it before the command |
| `--no-color` | Disable ANSI colors and terminal hyperlinks; place it before the command |

Running `crucible` without a command starts the interactive shell. See the [CLI overview](index.md) for setup, shell completion, and interactive usage.

`--json` is available for dataset, sample, and instrument `list` and `get`; project `list` and `get`; generic `get`; user `get`, `list`, and `search`; service-account `get` and `list`; account `show`; and dataset, sample, project, and instrument name or metadata searches. Collection and search commands return arrays, while singleton commands return objects.

## Dataset commands

Common creation example:

```bash
crucible dataset create -i data.csv -pid my-project \
    -n "XRD measurement" -m "X-ray diffraction" \
    --metadata '{"temperature_K": 300}' --keywords "XRD,powder"
```

Fields normally updated through `dataset update --set` include `dataset_name`, `measurement`, `data_type`, `session_name`, `data_format`, `timestamp`, and `public`. Use `reassign-project` and `transfer-ownership` for project and owner changes. Instrument reassignment remains unavailable and is not exposed as ordinary metadata editing.

## Project commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `project list` | List accessible projects |

| `instrument get INSTRUMENT` | Show an instrument by MFID or instrument slug |
| `instrument create` | Register an instrument |
| `instrument update MFID` | Update an instrument record or scientific metadata |

| `instrument edit MFID` | Edit instrument fields interactively |
| `instrument search QUERY` | Search names, types, and manufacturers |
| `instrument search-metadata QUERY` | Search scientific metadata; `search-md` is an alias |

## User commands

Most user-management commands require administrator permissions.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `user get USER` | Show a user by ORCID, MFID, username, or email |
| `user search QUERY` | Search names and usernames |
| `user list` | List users |
| `user create` | Create a user |
| `user update USER` | Update a user record |
| `user edit USER` | Edit a user record interactively |
| `user list-datasets USER [--limit N]` | List datasets accessible to a user |
| `user check-access USER DATASET_MFID` | Show a user's effective dataset access role |
| `user list-access-groups USER` | List a user's access groups |

| `user remove-access-group USER GROUP` | Deprecated; use the typed project or instrument membership command |
| `user list-projects USER` | List a user's projects |

Human users require a username and may optionally supply an ORCID during creation.
When the ORCID is omitted, the API assigns a canonical MFID.
Usernames are normalized to lowercase and must be 3 to 24 characters, start with a letter, contain only letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens, and contain no leading, trailing, or consecutive separators. Interactive creation validates each entry and prompts again when it is invalid.

## File commands

File commands operate on individual file MFIDs. Dataset-scoped file operations remain available under `dataset`.

| Command | Description |

| `sa rotate-key USER` | Generate a new key and invalidate the previous key |
| `sa get USER` | Show a service account |

| `ag list` | List join requests for review |
| `ag get ID` | Show a join request |
| `ag approve ID...` | Approve pending join requests |

| `deletion list` | List deletion requests |
| `deletion get ID` | Show a deletion request |
| `deletion approve ID...` | Approve pending requests |

| `deletion list-deleted` | List permanent-deletion audit records |
| `deletion get-deleted ID` | Show a permanent-deletion audit record |

## Cast command

`cast` loads a declarative `.crux` recipe containing datasets, samples, files, and links.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `cast FILE` | Execute a recipe |
| `cast FILE --validate` | Validate references and cycles without executing |

## Configuration and cache

| Command | Description |

| `config edit` | Edit the configuration file |
| `cache show` | Show cache location and disk usage |
| `cache clear` | Remove cached files by dataset, age, or all entries |

Configuration values can come from environment variables, the platform-specific config file, or defaults. Avoid displaying `api_key` in shared terminals or logs.

`dataset delete` and `cache clear` prompt before removing data. Use `--yes` only when the operation has already been explicitly approved, such as in a controlled noninteractive workflow.

Deprecated forms remain available for compatibility but emit a warning. New documentation and scripts should use the current forms.
