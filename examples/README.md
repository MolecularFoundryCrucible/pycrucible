# Crucible Examples

This directory contains example notebooks and data files demonstrating how to use the Crucible Python client.

## Files

### Notebooks

- **`crucible_tutorial.ipynb`** - Comprehensive tutorial covering core dataset and sample operations
- **`crucible_project_management.ipynb`** - Tutorial for project and user management, including operations that require elevated permissions

### Data Files (`data/` directory)

- **`thermal_conductivity_data.csv`** - Example thermal conductivity measurements (10 temperature points from 273-363 K)
- **`measurement_notes.txt`** - Example measurement notes and experimental conditions
- **`xrd_pattern.csv`** - Example X-ray diffraction pattern data
- **`thermal_measurement_preview.png`** - Example thumbnail image for datasets

## Tutorial Notebooks

### Main Tutorial (`crucible_tutorial.ipynb`)

The main tutorial demonstrates all core dataset and sample operations:

1. **Setup and Configuration** - Initializing the Crucible client
2. **Creating Samples** - Creating sample records in Crucible
3. **Creating Datasets and Files** - Creating dataset records, recursively discovering files, adding files later, replacing files explicitly, and re-uploading to an existing record
4. **Listing Datasets** - Retrieving datasets from a project
5. **Getting Dataset Details** - Retrieving dataset metadata
6. **Updating Dataset Metadata** - Modifying scientific metadata
7. **Downloading Dataset Files** - Retrieving files from datasets
8. **Linking Sample to Dataset** - Associating samples with datasets
9. **Linking Datasets** - Creating parent-child relationships between datasets
10. **Linking Samples** - Creating parent-child relationships between samples
11. **Adding Thumbnails** - Uploading preview images for datasets

### Project Management Tutorial (`crucible_project_management.ipynb`)

The project management tutorial includes administrative operations. Run only the sections allowed by your project or platform role:

1. **Setup and Configuration** - Initializing with credentials appropriate for the operations being demonstrated
2. **Creating Projects** - Creating or getting projects
3. **Getting Project Details** - Retrieving project information
4. **Listing Projects** - Viewing all accessible projects
5. **Creating Users** - Adding new users to Crucible
6. **Getting User Details** - Retrieving user information by ORCID or email
7. **Adding Users to Projects** - Granting project access to users
8. **Getting Project Users** - Listing team members for a project

## Running the Tutorials

### Prerequisites

1. Install nano-crucible:
   ```bash
   pip install -e /path/to/nano-crucible
   ```

2. Configure your API credentials:
   ```bash
   crucible config init
   ```

   You'll need:
   - **For main tutorial**: A Crucible API key with access to the selected project
   - **For project management tutorial**: A Crucible API key with the permissions needed for the operations you run
   - Access to project `crucible-demo` (or update the PROJECT_ID variable)

   **Alternative (without terminal access)**: If you don't have terminal access, you can initialize the client directly in your notebook:
   ```python
   from crucible import CrucibleClient
   client = CrucibleClient(
       api_url="https://crucible.lbl.gov/api/v3",
       api_key="your-api-key-here"
   )
   ```

3. Install Jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

### Running

Start with the main tutorial:

```bash
cd /path/to/nano-crucible/examples
jupyter notebook crucible_tutorial.ipynb
```

For project and user management:

```bash
cd /path/to/nano-crucible/examples
jupyter notebook crucible_project_management.ipynb
```

Or with JupyterLab:

```bash
cd /path/to/nano-crucible/examples
jupyter lab
```

## Notes

- Both tutorials use project ID `crucible-demo` by default - make sure you have access to this project or update the `PROJECT_ID` variable
- Project creation is available to authenticated human users. Some membership and user-management operations require elevated project or platform permissions.
- All example data files are located in the `data/` subdirectory
- The notebooks create new resources (samples, datasets, projects, users) in Crucible when executed
- Resource IDs are displayed for reference - you can use `crucible open <ID>` to view them in your browser
- Dataset files are added through `client.datasets.add_file()`. Domain-specific parsers remain available when local metadata extraction is needed.
- If running in VSCode Flatpak, you may need to set the API key as an environment variable (see notebook for details)
